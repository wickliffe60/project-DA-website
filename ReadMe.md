# Project Title
 Discover Art Studio Photography Webpage

## Project Description
I had an idea one day while going through the pictures on my mobile phone to create a website
of sunset images that could be displayed for people on the web to view at their leisure.  I wanted to share these
images to a wider audience in a more formal way than just sharing them on a social media website.  
I decided to create a website that was a gallery or portfolio of images. One that could link the visitor to my studio 
to purchase or contact me for reprints or downloads of prints or just ask me questions via voicemail.  To that end I incorporated CSS and Javascript features in the website including: 
* a CSS 'hamburger' menu that expands and collapes at mobile and desktop sizes
* a CSS flex feature of changing the homepage from a one column layout in mobile to a two col. layout on larger mobile devices/desktop
* a Javascript 'Contact Us' email validation form that displays to the user when the email is valid and then submitted
* a Javascript feature to move to the top of the webpage when scrolling down a page allowing user interaction with a button/mouseclick
